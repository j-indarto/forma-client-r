Access the FORMA data from R
==============

The objective of this small project is to allow easy access to the FORMA data from within R.  The API sill only supports aggregated FORMA counts for administrative boundaries; and this project appropriately structures requests from R for the aggregated FORMA counts by administrative unit and time period.
